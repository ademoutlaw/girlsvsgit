GIRLS VS GITHUB

Every username on GitHub is replaced with a
female username. Every Gravatar is replaced with a Gravatar of a woman's Facebook image.

Why? There is a death of women contributing to open source
software. This plugin is presented as a "filter" to challenge
assumptions about gender roles in software, and to "rewire" your
brain. 

The actual goal is to present such a ridiculous
"plugin" that people get frustrated and start a deeper discussion and
argument about gender and open source.

possible username examples: jenny88, jess2x, _amanda, ashley1982, sarah329,
hannahk, stephanieq... or maybe pull less spammy names like JessicasMommy, GirlinNYC, etc

The original idea of this plugin was birthed by @kylemcdonald on the @fatlab listerserve.
